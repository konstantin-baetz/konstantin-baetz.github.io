## Short Biography


I am currently finishing up my PhD in International Politics at the University of Konstanz. The topic of my dissertation is *Economic Statecraft in Multipolar Times*. As the title indicates, I am interested in the relationship between economics and foreign policy, specifically the use of economic means for foreign policy ends. This includes the study of trade wars and sanctions, which is analyze from the vantage of quantitative political science. 


### Hobbies

In my free time I enjoy playing chess, going for a bike ride, lifting weights in the gym and reading Brandon Sanderson books.
