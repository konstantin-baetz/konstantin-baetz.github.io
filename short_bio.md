## Short Biography

### Professional Profile

I am currently finishing up my PhD in International Politics at the University of Konstanz. The topic of my dissertation is *Economic Statecraft in Multipolar Times*. As the title indicates, I am interested in the relationship between economics and foreign policy, specifically the use of economic means for foreign policy ends. This includes the study of trade wars and sanctions, which I analyze from the vantage of quantitative political science. 

I firmly belive that foreign policy research should not be confined to the ivory tower. Hence I take an interest in the trade-off between policy relevance and methodological rigour. In my view, much of the current research output is hard to read for policy makers and does not adress their immediate questions.

I have presented my work at the European Political Science Association and American Political Science Association conferences. 


### Other Interests

In my free time I enjoy playing chess, going for a bike ride, lifting weights in the gym and reading Brandon Sanderson books. I also volunteer with the Amnesty International group in Konstanz.
